# Lab 0: Fun with IO Streams

**Objective**

- Use `g++` to compile and run C++ files
- Practice using input/output streams, primitive data types, and simple mathematical operators in C++
- Upload solution to GitHub Classroom

**Getting Started**

- Create a GitHub account and fork the repository
- Create a new folder for this project(this will make it easier to use GitHub)
- Complete at least 5 of the following challenges. You can use one file for all 5 and comment them out as you go or use 5 separate files. Label which challenge is which using comments.
	- [ ] Write a program to echo back user input
	- [ ] Write a program that reads a temperature in Celsius from the user and converts it to Fahrenheit
	- [ ] Write a program that reads an integer from the user and prints its factorial
	- [ ] Write a program that read a name from the user and says "Hello Name!" back
	- [ ] Write a program that determines whether an input string is a palindrome
	- [ ] Write a program that reads in two numbers and determines their sum
	- [ ] Write a program that reads in a number and returns whether it is even 
	- [ ] Write a program that reads a number of minutes from the user and converts it to hours and minutes
	- [ ] Write a program that reads the principal amount, rate of interest, and time period from the user and prints the simple interest
	- [ ] Write a program that reads a binary number and converts it to its decimal equivalent using bitwise shift operators. Output the decimal number.
-  **If you use outside resources, cite them in your code. Add a comment explaining how you used the resource and a link. Consult the [MIT Code Citation Guidelines](https://integrity.mit.edu/handbook/writing-code) for examples.**

**Deliverables**

- One or multiple C++ files with solutions to at least 5 challenges with proper citations
- A text or Markdown document with answers to the following:
	- What is a **primitive data type**? List the 5 primitive data types in C++.
	- What is the function of the `<<` and `>>` operators in C++. *Hint: there are 2 different meanings based on usage*
	- How did you handle potential errors or invalid inputs in your programs? 
	- What strategies did you use to debug your code?
	- How did you ensure your code was efficient and readable?


**Rubric**

*Course Content*

- 6 points - All required items are present. 
- 5 points - Task was completed, but supplementary materials are weak or missing.
	- Code was uncommented. 
	- Solution is correct but is significantly difficult to read, highly inefficient, very clumsy, very difficult to extend etc. From the original Jargon File, we would refer to solutions like this as *kludge*.
	- Reflection questions related to content were incorrect.
- 4 points - Task was attempted, but is missing major components. 
	- Coding prompt was only partially completed
	- Some deliverables are missing
- 3 points - Did not attempt or student should reattempt. 

*Workforce Readiness*

- 4 points - Exemplified  WFR standards
	- Language is professional. 
	- Work is clear and easy to read. 
	- Used deductive reasoning guide solution.
	- Reflection on own work was thoughtful and honest.
- 3 points - Practiced WFR standards
	- Language is readable but not professional. 
	- Work is understandable but not completely clear. 
	- Reflection on own work was weak.
	- Citations were not complete.
- 2 points - Developing WFR standards
	- Work is unprofessional. Significant spelling or grammar errors.
	- Did not attempt or student should reattempt.
